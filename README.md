## What's this then?

This project is supposed to be a rather specific Gumtree scraper that caters to searches for rental apartments. Given a Gumtree url (filtered or not, such as http://www.gumtree.com/flats-and-houses-for-rent/harrow/studio?distance=1.0&photos_filter=Y&price=up_to_200&seller_type=private), this little script should put the results in a usable data structure for further processing.

## wishlist:

- Filter by keywords ("all bills included")
- Filter by distance to nearest tube/train station
- Filter by multiple distances for specific tube lines ("less than 1.0 miles walk to a Metropolitan line station")
- Filter by travel distance to a certain station ("from nearest tube station to Euston in under 40 minutes")
- Filter by depravity index (http://opendatacommunities.org/deprivation/map)

Obviously I will never have time to do all this, so I'm posting this project on Github as partially complete while I work on it.
